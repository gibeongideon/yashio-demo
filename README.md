Test 3
1. Create a Laravel route that maps to a controller action named "HomeController@index".
2. In the HomeController, write a method named "index" that retrieves the latest five posts from the "Post" model and passes them to a view for display.
3. Create a view to display the retrieved posts in a list format.
4. Add a route parameter to the route created in step 1, allowing the user to pass a category ID to retrieve only posts from a specific category.
5. Update the HomeController@index method to handle the optional category parameter and retrieve posts accordingly.
